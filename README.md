# heart-disease-prediction
In this repository, I'm working on a classification problem which is Heart Disease Prediction. I'll use some basic techniques and apply classification algorithms.

# Predicting heart disease using Machine Learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based Machine learning and Data Science Libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical records or attributes.

# I'm going to take the following approach:
1. Problem Identification
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling 
6. Experimentation
# 1. Problem Identification
In a statement, Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

# 2. Data
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

# 3. Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll persue the project.

# 4. Features
This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
